                            Points, vectors, matrices and normals are to computer graphics what the alphabet is to literature; hence most CG books start with a chapter on linear algebra and geometry. However, for many looking to learn graphics programming, presenting a lot of maths before learning about making images can be quite upsetting. If you don't think CG programming is for you because you do not feel comfortable with maths or don't understand what a matrix is, don't give up now.
